The color scheme used when creating a website or application is one of the most crucial elements of web development. The general appearance and feel of the interface can be greatly influenced by a decent color scheme. In order to reduce eye fatigue and improve readability, many users favor a dark theme. Offering users the ability to switch between light and dark modes is essential as a result.

In this tutorial, we'll examine at how to use Sass to create a theme toggle. Sass is a powerful preprocessor that allows for the creation of modular and reusable CSS. We can create a theme option much more quickly by using Sass.

## Setting up the Colors

Let's take a minute to understand how the color scheme is structured before we start writing the code. We have two different color schemes in the code, `$light-theme`, and `$dark-theme`. Both of these themes contain a `primary` and `neutral` color palette.

```scss:scss/abstracts/_colors.scss
$light-theme: (
  'primary': (
    '600': #d900b5,
    '400': #ff85dc
  ),
  'neutral': (
    '100': '#f7f7f7',
    '200': '#e6e9ee',
    '300': '#dde0e4',
    '400': '#818890',
    '500': '#535661',
    '600': '#4b4c53',
    '700': '#3a3d4a',
    '800': '#2e3039',
    '900': '#1f2028'
  )
);

$dark-theme: (
  'primary': (
    '600': #d900b5,
    '400': #ff85dc
  ),
  'neutral': (
    '900': '#f7f7f7',
    '800': '#e6e9ee',
    '700': '#dde0e4',
    '600': '#818890',
    '500': '#535661',
    '400': '#4b4c53',
    '300': '#3a3d4a',
    '200': '#2e3039',
    '100': '#1f2028'
  )
);
```

Two shades of pink, represented by the values `600` and `400`, can be found in the `primary` color palette. These colors can be used to focus on important components like buttons, links, etc.

From light to dark, there are nine different shades in the `neutral` color palette. These shades can be applied to text colors, background colors, and other design components.

## Creating the CSS Variables

To start creating the theme toggle, define the CSS variables that will hold the color values. A `@each` loop that iterates over the color and shade values in the variable `$active-theme` can be used to do this. The `$active-theme` variable refers to either the `$light-theme` or the `$dark-theme`, depending on the current theme.

For each color and shade, we can create a CSS variable using the `--clr-#{$color}-#{$prop}` naming convention. The `#{$color}` and `#{$prop}` placeholders will be replaced with the actual color and shade values during compilation.

```scss:scss/base/_root.scss
:root {
  $active-theme: $light-theme;

  @each $color, $shade in $active-theme {
    @each $prop, $value in $shade {
      --clr-#{$color}-#{$prop}: #{$value};
    }
  }
}
```

This code uses the `:root` selector to define our CSS variables for each color and shade in the active theme. We loop over the color and shade values in the variable `$active-theme` using the `@each` function. For each color and shade, we create a CSS variable using the `--clr-#{$color}-#{$prop}` naming convention. During compilation, the placeholder values for `#{$color}` and `#{$prop}` are replaced with the actual color and shade values.

## Switching Themes

Now that we have our CSS variables defined, we can switch between the light and dark themes using a data attribute on the `html` element. To do this, we'll use another `@each` loop to iterate over the colors and shades in the `$dark-theme` and `$light-theme` variables.

Then, we'll use the `html[data-theme='dark']` selector to apply the color values of the dark theme to the appropriate CSS variables. The `:root` selector's values will use by default to the `html` element.

```scss:scss/base/_root.scss
:root {
  $active-theme: $light-theme;

  @each $color, $shade in $active-theme {
    @each $prop, $value in $shade {
      --clr-#{$color}-#{$prop}: #{$value};
    }
  }
}

html[data-theme='dark'] {
  @each $color, $shade in $dark-theme {
    @each $prop, $value in $shade {
      --clr-#{$color}-#{$prop}: #{$value};
    }
  }
}
```

Now we can repeat this process for the light theme by changing the selector to `html[data-theme='light']`.

## Toggling the Themes

We need to give the user a way to toggle between themes after we've defined them. JavaScript will be used to toggle the `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element in order to do this. We can listen for a click event on a toggle switch element and toggle the attribute accordingly.

```js
// Toggle between light and dark themes when the theme toggle button is clicked
const themeToggle = document.querySelector('.theme-toggle');
themeToggle.addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);

function toggleTheme() {
  const html = document.querySelector('html');
  const currentTheme = html.getAttribute('data-theme');

  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {
    setTheme('light');
  } else {
    setTheme('dark');
  }
}

function setTheme(theme) {
  const html = document.querySelector('html');
  html.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
}
```

This code selects an element in the Document Object Model (DOM) with a class of `theme-toggle` and adds a click event listener to it. When the button is clicked, the `toggleTheme()` function is called.

The html element is retrieved by the `toggleTheme()` function, which also returns the `data-theme` attribute's current value. Depending on the value of the attribute, it then calls the `setTheme()` function with either `light` or `dark` as an argument.

The `setTheme()` function gets the html element again and sets the value of the `data-theme` attribute to the value passed as an argument. This changes the theme of the page.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we looked at how to use Sass to create a theme toggle. First, we used variables to define our color schemes, and then we created CSS variables for each color and shade. We then used the `html[data-theme='dark']` and `html[data-theme='light']` selectors to apply the appropriate color values to the CSS variables. The user can now select between light and dark themes by using JavaScript to toggle the `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element.
