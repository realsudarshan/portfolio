Learning how to speed up your website is one of the most important things you can do. Due to the huge amount of factors they have an impact on, quickly loading pages are crucial for the success of websites.

## Reduce the size of the code

The JS and CSS codes should be minified because doing so would significantly increase site performance. If you merely cut the size of the code, you may save your site more than 500kb in advanced designs, because of its importance, pay attention to this point and don't worry about changing the files because when learning any Task Runner or using the SASS language, the output of the code is minified, so the minified version will never interact with it.

## Compress Images

The most crucial component of your website is its images. If you do not care about picture compression, it might significantly slow down your website. I worry a lot about this point since it is one of the most crucial aspects. Imagine me saving two full 2.5MB of photos alone, and imagine with me the speed of the site after compressing images.

Photos may be compressed in a variety of methods, whether you're using a Task Runner, image compression online, or an application like Photoshop with an action to save compressed images directly.

## Use SVG instead of images

Once you think about the advantages they provide, using SVG is a simple decision. For performance, you get superb quality on any device. There are yet additional justifications for using SVG for us as developers.

1. High performance
2. Small file size
3. Compressable
4. Integration with HTML, CSS, and XHTML
5. Scalable
6. Flexible

## Reduce the use of libraries

When you need something that can be accomplished in one or two lines of code, it may not always be necessary to use a complete library that contains all the features you could need.

Imagine with me, for example, that you want to create a navigation up button that appears to the user as they scroll down on the website. While many libraries offer this idea and a variety of possibilities, do you need it? Most users simply want to view the function of the button and press it to go to the top, so you have to decide if you need it.

## Reduce HTTP Server Requests

HTTP requests control how many files and how much overall data your website sends to users, which has an impact on load speeds.

A visitor will wait longer for your website to load the more files it has to transfer to them. Furthermore, downloading huge files takes longer than downloading small files.

How To Reduce HTTP Requests?

1. Do the above tips
2. Delete junk images
3. Activate browser caching
4. Fixing 404 Errors
5. Avoiding redirects

## Defer JavaScript

A file that is deferred won't load until all other files have finished loading. This is particularly helpful for bigger resources, such as JavaScript files, that aren't required for fully displaying a page. These are frequently referred to as "render-blocking resources" in performance testing tools, and you are prompted to load them in the footer.

```js
<script src="example.js" defer></script>
```
