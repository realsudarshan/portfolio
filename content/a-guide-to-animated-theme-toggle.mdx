## Understanding the CSS Variables

The provided CSS code makes use of CSS variables to define color schemes for light and dark themes. The `--clr-main` variable defines the main background color, while `--toggle-moon` and `--toggle-sun` provide the colors of the moon and sun buttons, respectively.

```CSS
html[data-theme='light'] {
  --clr-main: white;
  --toggle-moon: transparent;
  --toggle-sun: #ffe55b;
}

html[data-theme='dark'] {
  --clr-main: #000000;
  --toggle-moon: white;
  --toggle-sun: transparent;
}
```

## The HTML Document's Structure

Make sure your document semantics are correct and include the necessary meta tags for a cleanÂ HTML structure.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="light">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <title>Animated Theme Toggle</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button type="button" class="theme-toggle"></button>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Make sure to link the CSS and JavaScript files, then set the initial theme using the `data-theme` attribute.

## Styling the Body

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: var(--clr-main);
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}
```

The transition effect ensures a smooth color transition when the theme changes.

## Styling the Animated Theme Toggle Button

Sure! For the `.theme-toggle` button, let's add style to improve both its aesthetic appeal and user experience:

```css
.theme-toggle {
  border: 0;
  outline: 0;
  display: flex;
  z-index: 9999;
  cursor: pointer;
  -webkit-appearance: button;
  height: min(15vw, 65rem);
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  border-radius: 9999px;
  box-shadow: inset -15px -13px 3px -2px var(--toggle-moon);
  background-color: var(--toggle-sun);
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease, box-shadow 0.5s ease;
}
```

Let's break it down into parts:

**Webkit Appearance**: To improve cross-browser compatibility, the `-webkit-appearance: button` property maintains a button-like look while ensuring consistent rendering across browsers.

**Height and Aspect Ratio**: The toggle button's height is defined by its height attribute, which is set to `min(15vw, 65rem)`. A balanced and visually pleasing design is enhanced by the square form that is provided by the `aspect-ratio` of `1:1`.

**Box Shadow**: The `box-shadow` property provides an inset shadow (`inset -15px -13px 3px -2px var(--toggle-moon)`), creating depth. The color and offset values contribute to the toggle's visual appeal.

## JavaScript for Theme Switching

We need to give the user a way to toggle between themes after we've defined them. JavaScript will be used to toggle the `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element in order to do this. We can listen for a click event on a toggle switch element and toggle the attribute accordingly.

```js
// Toggle between light and dark themes when the theme toggle button is clicked
const themeToggle = document.querySelector('.theme-toggle');
themeToggle.addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);

function toggleTheme() {
  const html = document.querySelector('html');
  const currentTheme = html.getAttribute('data-theme');

  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {
    setTheme('light');
  } else {
    setTheme('dark');
  }
}

function setTheme(theme) {
  const html = document.querySelector('html');
  html.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
}
```

This code selects an element in the Document Object Model (DOM) with a class of `theme-toggle` and adds a click event listener to it. When the button is clicked, the `toggleTheme()` function is called.

The html element is retrieved by the `toggleTheme()` function, which also returns the `data-theme` attribute's current value. Depending on the value of the attribute, it then calls the `setTheme()` function with either `light` or `dark` as an argument.

The `setTheme()` function gets the html element again and sets the value of the `data-theme` attribute to the value passed as an argument. This changes the theme of the page.

## Conclusion

You can develop an advanced and animated theme toggle that improves the user experience and gives your website a visually attractive touch by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to customize the colors, animations, and styles to suit your design preferences.
